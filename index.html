          <h3>Male Chauvinism</h3>
          <img src="Images/gf.jpeg">
          
           <p>Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal Act: his birth.<q>In his novel Born A Crime</q>,We have seen  Abel wanted a  subservient woman  because he never falls in love with a subservient woman before. He  got married to Patricia  who was very independent and fearless woman now  he gets the opposite of the women he wanted. Since Abel  is  abusive and insecure man he wants to rule Patricia the way he wants. After giving birth to their son Andrew , they make  a trip to Abel's family for Christmas holiday. Abel wants Patricia to be that traditional wife to him that does all the house chores and that woman who respects her husband to the extends of bowing down to him. Although being submissive is a preference, forcing one to become submissive is an illustration of the lack of confidence. Abelâ€™s frustrated Patricia when she  quit her job and helped improve the garage business is a clear illustration of toxic masculinity. Out of her love for her husband and her desire to protect her investment, she  quited  a secure and well-paying job to help  her out and instead of receiving gratitude for her sacrifice, Abel gets frustrated. 
            Trevor mentions in his book that men go for independent women for them to be caged and exert their control over them. Since the writer grew up during the apartheid, black men were feeling the pressure of the regime where each and every move was controlled and decided by the white men. Feeling that their masculinity was limited in the outside world, they sought out an environment private enough to allow them to exert their authority freely. The perfect environment was their homes , an act of violence that was misinterpreted for love. I could say Patricia is a role model to many women 
          Abel really knows very well that Patricia is a modern woman and he wants to change the way Patricia  is. Just to mention some few women, before getting married to any man try so  hard to know the true color of the person you are going to get married to, that is why we have what we called courtship that is when you get to know each other, to avoid marriage issues.I could say Patricia is a role model to many women.</p>

  <h3>How humour Impacted Trevor Noah's Life</h3>
  <p> Humour is the tendecy of experience to provoke laughter. In Trevor Noah's novel<q>Born A Crime</q>,humour is shown when Trevor Noah decided to get some Jesus blood and Jesus body , drunk the entire bottle of grape juice and ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times he couldn't have in MaryVale since he doesn't like that school and so he wanted to get out from MaryVale School.</p>
<p>Trevor Noah described himself as a fast runner in his school since most  students from his school would  send him to the tuck shop because the queue was very long. Every time from the assembly he would tell everyone to place their orders, he would request them for a list of what they want, the percentage of what they want to spend and the food they wanted him to buy. This made him famous  and he was able to make friends. The balance he got from the shop he used them to buy lunch for himself and the money his mum gave him he saved them for pocket cash. 
 When other students were going back home , he could use the money to catch a bus home instead of walking or saving.
